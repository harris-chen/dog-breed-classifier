# Woof Cam (Dog Breed Classifier)

Given an image of a dog, the Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. To reduce training time without sacrificing accuracy, I trained a CNN using transfer learning.
