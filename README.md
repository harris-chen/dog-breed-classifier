# Woof Cam (Dog Breed Classifier)

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project. Given an image of a dog, the CNN will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. To reduce training time without sacrificing accuracy, I trained a CNN using transfer learning.
